Each test sequence will be in the form of a CSV file, broken up into a series of valve actions with the following columns:

1. Time (ms)
2. Valve 
3. Action

Rows should be in time order, and no time values should all be positive.

Valves are specified by number (could be changed to specifier.)

Action is the string "OPEN" or "CLOSE".
